    <h2>When the main ingredient demands respect</h2>
    <p>As a Barista turned Bartender, only to be turned back into a Barista (and in tandem an amateur Web Developer), 
        hearing Bartenders talk about coffee has always made me wince, and vice versa. Coffee as an ingredient can be 
        unforgiving. The window for extracting only the delicious flavors that coffee has to offer is both short and narrow, 
        which makes mistakes easy to make. 
        <br />
        When a someone makes a recipe that's hard to mess up, it's usually the culmination of raw experience and fleeting inspiration.
        Given that coffee can be so difficult to find consistency with, recipe's like James Hoffman's Coffee Amaro stand out. A bit
        of interest in sprits, a lot of coffee knowledge, and willingness to fuck around & find out has yeilding a recipe that will 
        live in my rolodex indefinitely.

        <h4>steps</h4>
        
        <li>With a mixer, cream the butter and sugars together. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until everything is smooth and incorporated.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda until they're all incorporated, too. Then start slowly folding that mixture into the wet ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips and nuts after that dough is done.</li>
        <li>I like to wrap them up in plastic wrap and then let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, but you don't have to. Either way, you want to make sure the dough is at room temperature before you pop them in the oven.</li>
        <li>I use a one-ounce scoop to measure out twelve perfect little dough balls on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit/205 degrees Celsius for ten minutes on the middle rack of your oven.</li>
        <li>I like to finish mine with some flaky sea salt.</li>
        <li>Makes about 20 cookies total.</li>
