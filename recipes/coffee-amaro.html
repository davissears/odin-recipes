    <h2>When the main ingredient demands respect</h2>
    <p>As a Barista turned Bartender, only to be turned back into a Barista (and in tandem an amateur Web Developer), 
        hearing Bartenders talk about coffee has always made me wince, and vice versa. Coffee as an ingredient can be 
        unforgiving. The window for extracting only the delicious flavors that coffee has to offer is both short and narrow, 
        which makes mistakes easy to make. 
        <br />
        When a someone makes a recipe that's hard to mess up, it's usually the culmination of raw experience and fleeting inspiration.
        Given that coffee can be so difficult to find consistency with, a recipe like James Hoffman's Coffee Amaro stands out. A bit
        of interest in sprits, a lot of coffee knowledge, and willingness to fuck around & find out has yielding a recipe that will 
        live in my rolodex indefinitely.
