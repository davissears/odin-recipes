    <h2>Easy, Quick & Delicious!</h2>
    <p>Oftentimes, I find the best iterations of classics come from unexpected sources. 
        A good cookie recipe is a product of repitition, ritual and refinement. This slow and steady
    approach to recipe development is often practiced by bartenders, so it makes sense that this recipe
    comes from the appropriately respected and awarded Jeffrey Morganthaler.

    <ul>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>1 stick butter (1/2 cup or 113 grams)</li>
        <li>75 grams light brown sugar</li>
        <li>125 grams white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp (5ml) vanilla extract </li>
        <li>175 grams flour</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>160 grams (roughly 1 cup) chocolate chips</li>
        <li>Optionally, 80 grams (roughly 1/2 cup) chopped nuts of your choice</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        
        <li>With a mixer, cream the butter and sugars together. Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until everything is smooth and incorporated.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda until they're all incorporated, too. Then start slowly folding that mixture into the wet ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add the chocolate chips and nuts after that dough is done.</li>
        <li>I like to wrap them up in plastic wrap and then let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, but you don't have to. Either way, you want to make sure the dough is at room temperature before you pop them in the oven.</li>
        <li>I use a one-ounce scoop to measure out twelve perfect little dough balls on a sheet pan.</li>
        <li>Bake at 400 degrees Fahrenheit/205 degrees Celsius for ten minutes on the middle rack of your oven.</li>
        <li>I like to finish mine with some flaky sea salt.</li>
        <li>Makes about 20 cookies total.</li>
