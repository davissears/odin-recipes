    <h2>A pragmatic iteration on a no-nonsense classic</h2>
    <p>There isnt much to say here. This dish is built on the the foundation of a reliable classic.
        Recipes like this are often referred to as "sturdy", which can make it challenging to justify
        making any changes at all. I find myself making this dish when i want to eat quickly, and will 
        usually use whatever leafy greens I happen to have. Kale is an especially good choice.  Hard to 
        mess up, easy to love, & greater than the sum of it's parts.

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>3 large or 4 smaller bunches kale, any type (about 1½ pounds)</li>
        <li>5 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>1/4<sup>th</sup>cup olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 ounces spaghetti, thick spaghetti, bucatini, or other long strand pasta</li>
        <li>Parmesan and crushed red pepper flakes (for serving)</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h4>steps</h4>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Meanwhile, strip kale leaves from ribs and stems, then tear leaves crosswise into 2"–3" pieces. Cook kale in boiling water until bright green and slightly softened, about 2 minutes. Using tongs, transfer kale to a colander and rinse under cold water, tossing; squeeze out excess liquid from leaves. Keep water at a boil (you’ll use it for the pasta).</li>
        <li>Whack garlic with the side of a chef’s knife to crush; peel off skins. Heat ¼ cup oil in a large heavy pot over medium. Cook garlic, stirring occasionally, until sizzling, about 3 minutes. Season very generously with black pepper and cook, smashing with a wooden spoon, until cloves break into rough pieces, soften, and look golden. Add kale to pot and cook, stirring often, until darkened in color and very tender, about 8 minutes (garlic will break into even smaller pieces). Season with kosher salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (2–3 minutes less than package directions).</li>
        <li>Using tongs, add pasta to kale; splash in about 1 cup pasta cooking liquid. Cook, tossing and adding more pasta cooking liquid as needed, until sauce lightly coats pasta, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve pasta topped with Parmesan, red pepper flakes, sea salt, and more black pepper.</li>
